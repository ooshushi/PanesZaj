					<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
					<img src="pfp.png">
					<p>I am Zaj Kenneth Panes, you can call me Zaj or Ken, you can call me anything you like it's up to you. I am 19 years old and currently enrolled as a 1st year BSCS student at Palawan State University. I am hoping that someday, in the future, I'd be able to achieve my dream of being a successful programmer. I spend my free time mostly by playing video games, listening to music, reading mangas/manhuas/manhwas, and watching anime.</p>
